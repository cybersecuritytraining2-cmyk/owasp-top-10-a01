      # VULNERABILITY 4 (Mass Assignment): the new account is built straight from
      # the request body via `params.permit!` — every key the client sends is
      # copied onto the account hash. The UI only submits `label`, but nothing on
      # the server restricts which attributes are accepted, so an attacker can
      # smuggle in extra fields the form never exposes. Posting
      #   { "label": "Savings", "balance": 250000 }
      # opens an account pre-loaded with a quarter-million dollars of money that
      # was never deposited; adding "number" lets them choose (or collide with)
      # an account number. The fix is to permit only :label and to force the
      # balance and number server-side.

      # VULNERABILITY 5 (Server-Side Template Injection): the customer-supplied
      # label is interpolated into an ERB template string that is then evaluated
      # on the server to produce a personalized welcome banner. Because the label
      # lands inside the template *before* ERB compiles it, any ERB tags the
      # customer types are executed server-side: a label of "<%= 7*7 %>" renders
      # as "49", and "<%= `id` %>" or "<%= system('…') %>" runs arbitrary shell
      # commands as the Rails process — full remote code execution. User input
      # must never be compiled as a template; it should be passed as plain data
      # (e.g. ordinary string interpolation in the JSON response, not ERB).

    # Ownership is enforced server-side: the statement can only be pulled for one
    # of the signed-in customer's *own* accounts. The dashboard backs this with a
    # dropdown of owned accounts, and the server re-checks here, so changing the
    # account number in the URL to someone else's just returns 404. This is the
    # correct pattern — contrast exports#create, which takes the account number
    # from the request body and forgets to re-check ownership.
