    # Returns the statement (transaction history) for an account.
    #
    # VULNERABILITY 2 (Broken Access Control / IDOR): the account number comes
    # straight from the URL and is used to look up transactions without ever
    # checking that it belongs to `current_user`. Any authenticated customer can
    # read anyone else's statement by changing the account number — e.g. a user
    # signed in as 5021-0001 can request /api/accounts/5021-0002/transactions
    # and see Bob's salary, rent, and spending. Account numbers are short and
    # sequential, so they are trivial to enumerate.
