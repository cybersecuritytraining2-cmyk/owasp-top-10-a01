    # Operations console used by Vault Street staff to monitor activity, read the
    # application logs, and block suspicious customers. It lives under /api/admin
    # and the matching screen is at /admin in the SPA. Neither is linked from the
    # customer UI, but the route is present in the client-side bundle.

      # VULNERABILITY 3 (Broken Access Control / Missing Function-Level
      # Authorization): these are staff-only operations, but the controller only
      # checks that the caller is *authenticated*, not that they are an *admin*.
      # The `require_admin!` filter exists in ApplicationController and is exactly
      # what should guard this controller — but it is never invoked here. As a
      # result any logged-in customer who discovers the admin routes (by reading
      # the JS bundle or fuzzing /api/admin/*) can read the full application logs
      # — which leak password-reset tokens, internal IPs and an API key — list
      # every customer's transactions, and block/unblock accounts.
      #
      #   before_action :require_admin!   # <-- the missing line
